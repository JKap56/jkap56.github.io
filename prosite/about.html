      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>
        At Mountain Bean Cafe, we saw a problem in our community: too many people settling for rushed mornings with bitter coffee that lacked both flavor and connection. In a town surrounded by the beauty of the Rockies, we believed the daily cup of coffee should feel as grounding and restorative as the mountains themselves—not just another item to cross off the to-do list.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s why we opened Mountain Bean Cafe: to promise more than just coffee. We hand-select ethically sourced beans, roast them with care, and serve them in a warm space where neighbors can slow down, share stories, and recharge. Whether it’s your first sip of the day or your last conversation before heading home, we’re here to make every moment a little richer, one cup at a time.
