            <p>
            The web is kind of like today’s Main Street—it’s where people go to find new businesses, 
            shop around, and connect. Whether you’re selling something you made or offering a service, 
            having a presence online is basically like having your own storefront that’s open all day,
            every day, for anyone around the world to stop by.
