        <h2> Assignment 1 - Today's Mainstreet Prompt </h2>
            <p>
            The web is kind of like today’s Main Street—it’s where people go to find new businesses, 
            shop around, and connect. Whether you’re selling something you made or offering a service, 
            having a presence online is basically like having your own storefront that’s open all day,
            every day, for anyone around the world to stop by.

        <h3> Business Idea - Diaper Service</h3>
            <p>
                People are become more environmentally conscious and backing businesses that help them acheive a more sustainable lifestyle with their wallets.
                Having too little ones right now I know I personally feel guilty with how many diapers end up in the trash.  We tried reusable diapers, but
                the time to clean/reset everything for the following week on top of all the other demands of being the parent of a new born make them practically
                unfeasbale to use for any real stretch of time.  A business that ships clean diapers weekly and provides a prepostaged way to ship back the dirty
                ones for laundering seems like an excellent business plan (if it doesn't already exist).
