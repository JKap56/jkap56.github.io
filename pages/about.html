  <h1>Our Story</h1>

  <p>
    Pitmaster Justin’s BBQ journey began over a decade ago with a simple backyard setup. What started as a hobby—grilling for friends and family—quickly turned
    into a deep passion for the craft and culture of barbecue. Over the years, Justin has refined his techniques and now brings that same backyard flavor straight to your event.
